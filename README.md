A Microsoft-maintained build of [uutils/coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils),
[findutils](https://github.com/uutils/findutils), and [grep](https://github.com/uutils/grep) packaged as a
single multi-call binary for Windows. The goal is to make moving between Linux, macOS, WSL,
containers, and Windows frictionless: the same commands, flags, and pipelines work the same
way, so existing scripts carry over without translation.

Each command supports the standard `--help` flag for full syntax and options.

**This project is in preview.**

<br/>

## Install

Install Coreutils for Windows with WinGet:

```powershell
winget install Microsoft.Coreutils
```

Or grab the latest build from our [Release Page](https://github.com/microsoft/coreutils/releases/latest).

## Shell conflicts

> [!NOTE]
> Any command not mentioned is included in this suite. The following only lists conflicts.

> [!WARNING]
> PowerShell 7.4 or newer is required. Older PowerShell versions aren't supported.

Several commands share names with built-ins in CMD and PowerShell. Whether the Coreutils
version runs depends on the shell, the PATH order, and (for PowerShell) the alias table.

Legend: ✅ ships and works · ⚠️ ships but conflicts with a built-in · 🛑 not shipped

| `kill`     |  🛑  |       🛑        | Unavailable due to lack of signals on Windows; Implementing a form of SIGTERM/SIGKILL may be possible in the future however |

## Windows caveats

| Difference            | Detail |
| --------------------- | ------ |
| **CRLF line endings** | Windows text files often use CRLF (`\r\n`). Most utilities handle this transparently, but pattern matching with `$` and exact byte counts can be affected. |
| **No `/dev/null`**    | Use `NUL` instead, for example `find . -name "*.log" > NUL` |
| **No POSIX signals**  | Signals such as `SIGHUP`, `SIGPIPE`, and `SIGUSR` aren't available. `Ctrl+C` (`SIGINT`) works as expected. |
| **Path separators**   | Both `/` and `\` are accepted. Some utilities produce `\`-separated output, which can affect downstream piping. |
| **File permissions**  | Windows uses ACLs, not POSIX permission bits. Permission-based predicates (for example `find -perm`) may behave differently or be unavailable. |
| **Symbolic links**    | Reading existing symbolic links works without elevation. Creating new symbolic links requires Developer Mode ([**Settings > System > Advanced**](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/advanced-settings)) or an elevated terminal. |

### Intentionally dropped

Commands that exist upstream but aren't shipped here because they rely on POSIX-only concepts, would break existing Windows scripts, or simply aren't useful on Windows.

* `dd`: Perhaps useful in the future.
* `dircolors`, `shred`, `sync`, `uname`: Not particularly useful on Windows.
* `chcon`, `chgrp`, `chmod`, `chown`, `chroot`, `groups`, `hostid`, `id`, `install`,
  `logname`, `mkfifo`, `mknod`, `nice`, `nohup`, `pathchk`, `pinky`, `runcon`, `stdbuf`,
  `stty`, `tty`, `users`, `who`: POSIX-only concepts unavailable on Windows.
